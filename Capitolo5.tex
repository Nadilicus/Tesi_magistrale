\chapter{Gauss map and spacelike immersion}

section{Spacelike surface}
In this section we will briefly talk about geometric property of immersed spacelike surfaces, that is the analogous of the theory for the Euclidean space.\\
Let us denote with $\nabla$ the Levi-Civita connection of the Lorentzian metric of $\A^{2,1}$. Given a spacelike immersion $\sigma: S\to\A^{2,1}$ the pull-back metric $\I = \sigma^*(g_{\A^{2,1}})$ is called \textit{first fundamental form} of $\sigma$.
The tangent bundle $TS$ is naturally identified to a subbundle of the pull-back $\sigma^*(TM)$, therefore we can define its normal bundle $N_\sigma$. Using the decomposition
\[
    \sigma^* TM = TS \oplus N_\sigma,
\]
the pull-back of the Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$, restricted to sections tangent to $S$ splits as the sum of the Levi-Civita connection of the first fundamental form $\I$ and a symmetric $2-form$ with value in $N_\sigma$. Given the time-orientability, we take the future-directed unit normal vector field $\nu$ of $S$. The Levi-Civita connection $\nabla^\I$ of the first fundamental form $\I$ of S is defined by the relation:
\[
    \nabla_V W= \nabla^\I_V W + \II(V,W)\nu,
\] 
where the $(2,0)$-tensor $\II$ is called \textit{second fundamental form} of $\sigma$. The \textit{shape  operator} of $\sigma$ is a $(1,1)$-tensor $B$ defined as
\[
    B(V) = - \nabla_V N.
\]
The shape operator is related to the second fundamental form by
\[
    \II(V,W) = \I(B(V),W).
\]
In particular, $B$ is diagonalisable and its eigenvalues are colled principal curvatures.\\
The first and second fundamental form of an immersion $\sigma$ satisfy constraint equations known as the \textit{Gauss-Codazzi equations}. More precisely the Gauss equation consists of the identity
\[
    K_\I = -1 - \text{det}B.
\]
The Codazzi equation tells us that
\[
    d^{nabla^\I}B=0,
\]
where $d^{nabla^\I}$ is the operator defined by
\[
    (d^{nabla^\I}B)(V,W) = \nabla^\I_V(B(W)) - \nabla^\I_W(B(V)) - B([V,W]).
\]
Sometimes is also written in the equivalent form 
\[
    (\nabla^\I_V \II)(W,U) = (\nabla^\I_W \II)(V,U).
\]
As in the Euclidean space, the embedding data $I$ and $\II$ of a simply connected surface determines the immersion uniquely up to isometries of $\A^{2,1}$
\begin{theorem}
    Let $S$ be a simply connected surface, let $\I$ be a Riemannian metric on $S$ and $\II$ be a symmetric $(2,0)$-tensor on $S$. If $\I$ and $\II$ satisfy the Gauss-Codazzi equations, then there exists a spacelike immersion $\sigma:S \to\A^{2,1}$ having $\I$ and $\II$ as first and second fundamental form. Moreover if $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ are two such immersions, then there exists a time-preserving isometry $\varphi$ of $\A^{2,1}$ such that $\sigma' = \varphi \circ \sigma$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Germs of spacelike immersions}
Let us now consider che case in which $S$ is an oriented surface, not necessarily simply connected. Let $\sigma: S \to(M,g)$ a spacelike immersion where $(M,g)$ is an oriented AdS spacetime.
As in the previous section, we can associate to $\sigma$ the pair $(\I,\II)$ of first and secund fundamental form, where $\II$ is  computed with respect to the unit normal vector $\nu$ of $\sigma$.
We will always assume that the orientation of $S$ and $\nu$ are compatible with the one on $M$.
We want to prove that the pair $(\I,\II)$ depends only on the \textit{germ} of $\sigma$, which is defined as follow:
