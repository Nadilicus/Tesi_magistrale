\chapter{Minimal Lagrangian diffeomorphism}

\begin{definition}
    Let $h$ and $h'$ be two hyperbolic metrics on the closed surface $S$. A diffeomorphism $f: (S,h) \to (S,h')$ is \textit{minimal Lagrangian} if its graph is a minimal Lagrangian submanifold of $S\times S$ with respect to the product metric $h \oplus h'$ and the symplectic form $\pi_l^*\omega_h - \pi_r^* \omega_{h'}$.
