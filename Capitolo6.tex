\chapter{Minimal Lagrangian diffeomorphism}

\section{CMC foliation}
A smoothly embedded spacelike surface $S$ has \textit{constant mean curvature} if the trace of the shape operator $B$ is constant. A \textit{maximal surface} is a surface $S$ whose mean curvature is constantly equal to zero.




\section{Minimal Lagrangian diffeomorphism}
\begin{definition}
    Let $h$ and $h'$ be two hyperbolic metrics on the closed surface $S$. A diffeomorphism $f: (S,h) \to (S,h')$ is \textit{minimal Lagrangian} if its graph is a minimal Lagrangian submanifold of $S\times S$ with respect to the product metric $h \oplus h'$ and the symplectic form $\pi_l^*\omega_h - \pi_r^* \omega_{h'}$. 
\end{definition}
