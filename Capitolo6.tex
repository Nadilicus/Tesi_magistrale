\section{CMC Surfaces}
A smoothly embedded spacelike surface $S$ has \textit{constant mean curvature} (CMC) if the trace of the shape operator $B$ is constant. A \textit{maximal surface} is a surface $S$ whose mean curvature is constantly equal to zero.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:CMC_foliation}
    Every MGH Anti-de Sitter manifold with compact Cauchy surface is uniquely foliated by closed CMC surfaces, where the mean curvature $H$ varies in $(-\infty,\infty)$. In particular every MGH Anti-de Sitter manifold with compact Cauchy surface admits a unique maximal surface.
\end{theorem}
The proof of theorem \ref{thm:CMC_foliation} can be found in \cite{barbot2004constant} and revolves around the existance of a pair of barriers, which are two surfaces with everywhere positive/negatime mean curvature, respectively.\\

Using the normal evolution
\[
    \sigma_t(x) = \text{exp}_{\sigma(x)} (t\nu(x))
\]
one can find a relation between CMC and constanc Gaussian curvature (CGC) surfaces, namely surfaces where the determinant of the shape operator is constant:
\begin{proposition}
    Let $\sigma: S \to\A^{2,1}$ be an immersion of constant Gaussian curvature $K>0$. Then the normal evolution $\sigma_{t_K}$ on the convex side of $\sigma$, for time $t_K=\text{arctan}(K^{1/2})$, is an immersion of constant mean curvature $H=K^{-1/2}(K-1)$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    By Lemma \ref{lem:tub metric} the first fundamental form $\I_t$ of $\sigma_t$ is given by
    \[
        \I_t(\cdot, \cdot) = \I((\cos(t)id + \sin(t)B)\cdot, (\cos(t)id + \sin(t)B)\cdot).
    \]
    Let us denote by $B_t$ the shape operato of $\I_t$. By Remark \ref{prop:Gaussian curvature} we have
    \[
        K_I = \frac{K_{\I_t}}{\text{det}(\cos(t)id - \sin(t)B_t)} = - \frac{1+\text{det}B_t}{\cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t)\text{det} B_t -\cos(t) \sin(t)\text{tr} B_t}.
    \]
    Hence $K_I$ is constant if and only if $\text{tr} B_t = 2/ \tan(2t)$, that happens for $\tan(t) = 1 / \sqrt{K_\I}$.
\end{proof}

\section{Minimal Lagrangian diffeomorphism}

\red{da finire}
\begin{definition}
    Let $h$ and $h'$ be two hyperbolic metrics on the closed surface $S$. A diffeomorphism $f: (S,h) \to (S,h')$ is \textit{minimal Lagrangian} if its graph is a minimal Lagrangian submanifold of $S\times S$ with respect to the product metric $h \oplus h'$ and the symplectic form $\pi_l^*\omega_h - \pi_r^* \omega_{h'}$. 
\end{definition}
