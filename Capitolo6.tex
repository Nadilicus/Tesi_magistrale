\section{CMC Surfaces}
A smoothly embedded spacelike surface $S$ has \textit{constant mean curvature} (CMC) if the trace of the shape operator $B$ is constant. A \textit{maximal surface} is a surface $S$ whose mean curvature is constantly equal to zero.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:CMC_foliation}
    Every MGH Anti-de Sitter manifold with compact Cauchy surface is uniquely foliated by closed CMC surfaces, where the mean curvature $H$ varies in $(-\infty,\infty)$. In particular every MGH Anti-de Sitter manifold with compact Cauchy surface admits a unique maximal surface.
\end{theorem}
The proof of theorem \ref{thm:CMC_foliation} can be found in \cite{barbot2004constant} and revolves around the existence of a pair of barriers, which are two surfaces with everywhere positive/negatime mean curvature, respectively.\\
Given a spacelike immersion $\sigma$, by Lemma \ref{lem:tub metric}
\[
    B_t = (\cos(t) id + \sin(t) B)^{-1}(-\sin(t) id + \cos(t) B).
\]
Let $\lambda(x)$, $\mu(x)$ be the eigenvalues of $B$, by direct computation one find that
\begin{equation} \label{eq:eigenvalues}
    \lambda_t(x) = \frac{\lambda(x)+\tan(t)}{1- \lambda(x)\tan(t)} \ \ \ \ \ \mu_t(x) = \frac{\mu(x)+\tan(t)}{1- \mu(x)\tan(t)} \ .
\end{equation}
In general one can find a relation between CMC and constant Gaussian curvature (CGC) surfaces, namely surfaces where the determinant of the shape operator is constant, see \cite{chen2017constantmeancurvaturefoliation}. Here we show a weaker result which will prove useful in the proof of the main result:
\begin{proposition} \label{prop:cmc to cgc}
    Let $\sigma: S \to\A^{2,1}$ be a maximal surface. Then the normal evolution $\sigma_{t}$ at the time $t= \pi / 4$ is an immersion of constant Gaussian curvature $K = -2$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    By Equation \ref{eq:eigenvalues} the Gaussian curvature at $x$ is given by
    \[
        K_t(x) = \frac{\lambda(x)\mu(x) + \lambda(x)\tan(t) + \mu(x)\tan(t) + \tan^2(t)}{1 - \lambda(x)\tan(t)- \mu(x)\tan(t) + \lambda(x)\mu(x)\tan^2(t)}.
    \]
    Since $sigma$ gives a maximal surface, we have $\mu(x) = -\lambda(x)$ and therefore
    \[
        K_t(x) = \frac{\lambda(x)\mu(x) + \tan^2(t)}{1 + \lambda(x)\mu(x)\tan^2(t)}
    \]

\section{Minimal Lagrangian diffeomorphism}

\red{da finire}
\begin{definition}
    Let $h$ and $h'$ be two hyperbolic metrics on the closed surface $S$. A smooth map $f: (S,h) \to (S,h')$ is \textit{minimal Lagrangian} if its graph is a minimal Lagrangian submanifold of $S\times S$ with respect to the product metric $h \oplus h'$ and the symplectic form $\pi_l^*\omega_h - \pi_r^* \omega_{h'}$. 
\end{definition}

Consider the GMH spacetime $M$ whose holonomy $\rho = (\rho_l, \rho_r)$ induces $h$ and $h'$ as quotient metric in $\H^2 / \rho_l(\pi_1 \Sigma)$ and $\H^2 / \rho_r(\pi_1 \Sigma)$. Let now $\Sigma_0$ the unique maximal surface in $M$, we want to prove that the associated map $f_0$ is a minimal Lagrangian diffeomorphism.\\
First we prove that $f_0$ is a diffeomorphism. By Proposition \ref{prop:cmc to cgc} $\Sigma_0$ is obtained from a surface $\Sigma_1$ of constant Gaussian curvature equal to $-2$. The right and left projection of the Gauss map are always local diffeomorphism on a surface with curvature different from $0$, and by a topological argument the projections of the Gauss map associated to $\Sigma_1$ are diffeomorphism. Now, recalling that spacelike immersions which differ from one another by the normal evolution have the same image, we have that the projections are diffeomorphism for $\Sigma_0$, and therefore $f_0$ is a diffeomorphism. Moreover the Lagrangian condition is equivalent to the fact that $f_0$ is area-preserving, and we proved in Section \ref{sec:gauss map} that this is always verified by the image of the Gauss map.\\
\red{We now want to prove that the Gauss map is harmonic and conformal, which implies that it is minimal.}\\
By proposition \ref{prop:left right pull-back metric}, the pull-back metric of the product Riemannian metric has the expression $2(\I + \III)$. Being $B$ traceless, by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem $B^2 + (\text{det}B)id = 0$. Now, using that $B$ is $\I$-symmetric, we have that $\III = -(\text{det})I$, showing conformality.\\
To prove the harmonicity of the Gauss map it suffices to prove that the left and right projection are harmonic. We check the harmonicity of $\Pi_l$, the proof is the same for $\Pi_r$. To see this we can write the target metric
\[
    \Pi_l^*g_{\H^2}=I((\text{id}-\mathcal{J}B)\cdot,(\text{id}-\mathcal{J}B)\cdot) = \I(\cdot, \cdot) + \III(\cdot, \cdot) - 2\I(\mathcal{J}B \cdot, \cdot),
\]
where we used that $B$ is traceless and therefore $\mathcal{J}B$ is $\I$-symmetric. Moreover $\mathcal{J} B$ is $I$-Codazzi. By \red{lemms} $- 2\I(\mathcal{J}B \cdot, \cdot)$ is the real part of the Hopf differential of $\Pi_l$ which is holomorphic since $\mathcal{J}B$ is $I$-Codazzi. Hence, by \red{lemma harmonic iff HQD} we have that $\Pi_l$ is harmonic.
