\section{The $\PSL$-model}
In dimension three there is a special model which endows Anti-de Sitter space with a Lie group structure.
Consider the vector space $\mathcal{M}(2,\R)$ of $2 \times 2$ matrices with real entries and the quadratic form $q= -det$ that has signature $(2,2)$.
This gives an identification between $(\mathcal{M}(2,\R), -det)$ and $(\R^{2,2},q_{2,2})$, unique up to composition by elements in $O(2,2)$, and under this isomorphism $\H^{2,1}$ is identified with the Lie group $SL(2,\R)$.\\
$SL(2,\R)\times SL(2,\R)$ acts linearly on $\mathcal{M}(2,\R)$ by left and right multiplication:
\[
    (A,B) \cdot X := AXB^{-1}    
\]
preserving the quadratic form $q = -det$. Therefore it induces a representation
\[
    SL(2,\R)\times SL(2,\R) \to O(\mathcal{M}(2,\R),q).
\]
The kernel of this representation is given by $K=\{ (\1,\1),(-\1,-\1) \}$, and by dimensional argument it is the connected component of the identity:
\[
    \text{Isom}_0(\H^{2,1}) \cong SO_0(\mathcal{M}(2,\R),q) \cong SL(2,\R)\times SL(2,\R) / K.
\]
Using this model there is a natural identification of $\A^{2,1}$ with the Lie group $\PSL$ and
\[
    \text{Isom}_0(\A^{2,1}) \cong \PSL \times \PSL
\]
acting by left and right multiplication on $\PSL$.
The stabilizer of the identity in $\text{Isom}_0(\A^{2,1})$ is the diagonal subgroup $\Delta < \PSL \times \PSL$.\\

\section{The boundary of $\PSL$}
From the identification between $\A^{2,1}$ and $\PSL$ we obtain an identification of $\partial \A^{2,1}$ with the boundary of $\PSL$ into $P(\mathcal{M}(2,\R))$, which is the projectivization of rank 1 matrices:
\[
    \partial \A^{2,1} = \{ [X] \in P(\mathcal{M}(2,\R)) \ | \ rank(X)=1 \}.
\]
We have a homeomorphism
\begin{align*}
    \partial \A^{2,1} \to \T \\
    [X] \to (\text{Im}X, \text{Ker}X)
\end{align*}
equivariant under the action of $\PSL \times \PSL$, acting on $\partial\A^{2,1}$ as the natural extension of the action on $\A^{2,1}$, and by left multiplication on $\T$.\\
The equivariance is easily checked observing that $\text{Im}(AXB^{-1}) = A \cdot \text{Im}(X)$ and $\text{Ker}(AXB^{-1}) = B \cdot \text{Ker}(X)$.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:inversion}
    The inversion map $\iota [X] = [X]^{-1}$ is a time-reversing isometry of $\A^{2,1}$ which induces the homeomorphism $(x,y) \to (y,x)$ on $\partial \A^{2,1} \cong \T$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    The map $\iota$ is equivariant with respect to the isomorphism of $\PSL \times \PSL$ that switches the two factors.
    To show that it is an time-reversing isometry it thus suffices to check the differential at the identity, which is clearly $d_\1 \iota = -\1$.\\
    To check the second claim we observe that for an invertible $2 \times 2$ matrix we have $(detX)X^{-1} = (trX)\1 - X$ by Cayley-Hamilton theorem, so that projectively $[X^{-1}]=[(trX) \1 - X]$ along the boundary.
    This shows that the inversion map on $\A^{2,1}$ extends to the transormation $[X] \to [(trX)\1 - X]$ along the boundary.
    Let $X$ be a rank 1 matrix, it is traceless if and only if $X^2 =0$, that is, if and only if $\text{Ker}X=\text{Im}X$, and in this case the statement is easily proven.
    If $trX \neq 0$ then $X$ is diagonalizable with eigenvalues $0$ and $trX$. Moreover $\text{Ker}X$ and $\text{Im}X$ are the corresponding eigenspaces and it is easily seen that $\text{Ker}((trX)\1 -X) = \text{Im}X$ and $\text{Im}((trX)\1 -X) = \text{Ker}X$.
\end{proof}

Using the half-plane model for the hyperbolic space $\H^2$, $\S$ is identified to the boundaty at infinity $\partial \H^2$ and $\PSL$ corresponds to $\text{Isom}_0(\H^2)$, which acts on $\S$ in the canonical way.
Therefore one can identify $\partial \A^{2,1}$ with $\partial \H^2 \times \partial \H^2$ and we can interpret the convergence to $\partial \A^{2,1}$ in the following way:
\begin{lemma} \label{lem:convergence}
    A sequence $[X_n] \in \A^{2,1}$ converges to $(x,y) \in \partial \A^{2,1} \cong \T$ if and only if for every $p\in\H^2$, $X_n(p) \to x$ and $X_n^{-1}(p) \to y$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    It suffices to check that the condition holds for some $p\in\H^2$ since the action of $\PSL$ on $\H^2$ is isometric. Therefore we can take $p=i\in\H^2$. Assume $\left[ X_n \right]$ converges projectively to $\left[ X \right] \in \partial\A^{2,1}$. This means that there is a sequence of real number such that
    \[
       \lambda_n X_n = \lambda_n
       \begin{pmatrix}
            a_n & b_n \\ c_n & d_n
        \end{pmatrix} \to
        \begin{pmatrix}
            a & b \\ c & d
        \end{pmatrix} =X.
    \]
    Without loss of generality, we can assume $\lambda_n a_n \to a \neq 0$. Then 
    \[
        X(i) = \lim_{n\to \infty} \lambda_n \frac{a_n i + b_n}{c_n i + d_n} = \frac{ai +b}{ci+d} = \frac{ai + b}{ ci + \frac{bc}{a}} = \frac{a(ai+b)}{c(ai+b)} = \frac{a}{c}.
    \]
    Using the identification between $\S$ and $\R \cup \{ \infty \} = \partial_\infty \H^2$ we have that $\frac{a}{c} = \text{Im}(X)$. The convergence of $X_n^{-1}(i) \to \text{Ker}(X)$ follows from Lemma \ref{lem:inversion}.
\end{proof}

In this dimension $\partial\A^{2,1}$ is double ruled quadric. Given any $(x_0,y_0) \in \partial\A^{2,1}$ we refer to
\[
    \lambda_{y_0} := \{ (x,y_0) \ | \ x \in\S \}
\]
as the \textit{left ruling} through $(x_0,y_0)$, and similarly we refer to
\[
    \mu_{x_0} := \{ (x_0,y) \ | \ y \in\S \}
\]
as the \textit{right ruling} through $(x_0,y_0)$. The left and right rulings describe projective lines in $\mathbb{R}P^3$ which is cointained in $\partial\A^{2,1}$, hence lightlike for the conformal Lorentzian structure of $\partial\A^{2,1}$.
\begin{proposition} \label{prop:angular}
    Let $\pi_l, \pi_r : \T \to\S$ be the canonical projections and $d\theta$ the angular form on $\R$. Then the symmetric product $\pi_l^*(d\theta)\pi_r^*(d\theta)$ is in the conformal class of $\partial\A^{2,1}$.
\end{proposition}
Therefore a $C^1$ curve in $\partial\A^{2,1}$ is spacelike when it is locally the graph of an orientation preserving function, and timelike when it is locally the graph of an orientation reversing function.

\section{Levi-Civita connection and cross-product}
Any Lie group $G$ is equipped with two natural connection, the \textit{left-invariant connection} $D^l$ and the \textit{right-invariant connection} $D^r$. For example, $D^l$ is uniquely determined by the condition that left-invariant vector fields are parallel, and is left-invariant in the sense that
\[
    (L_g)_*(D^l_V W) = D^l_{(L_g)_*(V)} (L_g)_*(W),
\]
where $L_g :G \to G$ is the left multiplication by $g$. The connection $D^l$ at a point $g\in G$ can be expressed as
\[
    D^l_V W = \left. \frac{d}{dt} \right|_{t=0} (L_{g \gamma(t)^{-1}})_* (W_{\gamma(t)})
\]
where $\gamma(t)$ is a path with $\gamma(0) = g$ and $\gamma'(0) = V$.
In an analogous way one define the right-invariant connection $D^r$. Both connections $D^l$ and $D^r$ are flat and compatible with any metric which is left-invariant or right-invariant respectively. But this connections are not torsion-fre, by computation one obtain that
\[
    \tau^l (V,W) = - \left[ V,W \right]
\]
and
\[
    \tau^r (V,W) = \left[ V,W \right].
\]
A direct computation also shows that
\[
    D^r_V W - D^l_V W = \left[ V,W \right].
\]
Now, given a bi-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metric on $G$, its Levi-Civita connection $\nabla$ can be expressed via $D^l$ and $D^r$ as 
\[
    \nabla_V W = \frac{1}{2} (D^l_V W + D^r_V W).
\]
In our case, $\PSL$ is equipped with a natural Lorentzian cross-product which can be used to rewrite the expression for the Levi-Civita connection. The cross-product on $\PSL$ is a $T \A^{2,1}$-valued 2-form $(V,W) \to V \boxtimes W$, which is defined by the equality
\[
    \langle V \boxtimes W , U \rangle = \Omega(V,W,U),
\]
where $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$ is the Anti-de Sitter metric and $\Omega$ is the associated volume form. In this setting
\[
    \left[ V,W \right] = -2 V \boxtimes W.
\]
This permits to rewrite the expression for the Levi-Civita connection of leftinvariant vector fields as
\[
    \nabla_V W = - V \boxtimes W = D^l_V W - V \boxtimes W = D^r_V W + V \boxtimes W.
\]
\section{Geodesics in $\PSL$}
Let us start by understanding the geodesics through the identity. Using the Lie group structure of $\A^{2,1}$ it suffices to understand the one-parameter subgroup of $\A^{2,1}$
(the necessary tools in Lie groups theory are introduced in \cite{bonsanteseppi}). We get the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Timelike geodesics are, up to conjugacy, of the form
    \[ \begin{pmatrix}
        \text{cos}(t) & -\text{sin}(t) \\
        \text{sin}(t) & \text{cos}(t)
    \end{pmatrix} \]
    under the identification of $\PSL$ with $Isom(\H^2)$ they are elliptic one-parameter groups fixing a point in $\H^2$.
    \item Spacelike geodesics are, up to conjugacy
    \[ \begin{pmatrix}
        \text{cosh}(t) & \text{sinh}(t) \\
        \text{sinh}(t) & \text{cosh}(t)
    \end{pmatrix} \]
    these are hyperbolic one-parameter groups fixing two points in the boundary of $\H^2$
    \item Lightlike geodesics are the parabolic one-parameter groups conjugate to
    \[ \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & t \\
        0 & 1
    \end{pmatrix} \]
\end{itemize}
Using this description of timelike geodesics through $\1$, we can also interpret the duality in $\A^{2,1}$. Recalling that the dual plane of a point $A$ is the set of antipodal points along timelike geodesics through $A$, one sees that the dual plane of $\1$ consists of elliptic order-two isometries of $\H^2$. Equivalently, this is the set of (projective classes) of traceless matrices, that is (by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem)
\[
    P_\1 = \{ [J]\in\PSL \ | \ J^2 = -\1 \}.
\]
The boundary at infinity of $P_\1$ is made of traceless matrices of rank 1.\\
The stabilizer of $\1$ is the diagonal subgroup of $\PSL \times \PSL$, and it aso acts on the dual plane $P_\1$ by conjugation. Therefore the following statement is straightforward:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:dual plane}
    The map from $\H^2$ to $P_\1$, sending $p\in\H^2$ to the elliptic order-two element in $\PSL$ fixing $p$, is a $\PSL$-equivariant isometry.
\end{lemma}

\noindent\textit{Timelike geodesics}.
To get a complete description of timelike geodesics it suffices to let the isometry group of $\A^{2,1}$ act on geodesics through the identity.
\begin{proposition}
    There is a homeomorphism between the space of timelike geodesics of $\A^{2,1}$ and $\H^2 \times \H^2$.
    The homeomorphism is equivariant for the action of $Isom_0(\A^{2,1}) \cong \PSL \times \PSL$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    We define the homeomorphism as follows. Given a pair $(p,q) \in \H^2\times\H^2$ associate to it the set
    \[
        L_{p,q} = \{X \in \PSL \ | X \cdot q = p\}.
    \]
    
    By a previous discussion, geodesics through the identity are of the form $L_{p,p}$ for some $p\in\H^2$. The action of $(A,B) \in \PSL \times \PSL$ sends $L_{p,q}$ to $L_{A\cdot p, B\cdot q}$ which implies that the map is equivariant under the action of $\PSL\times\PSL$, that $L_{p,q}$ is an unparametrized timelike geodesic and that all unparametrized timelike geodesics are of this form. This shows in particular that the map defined is surjective.
    Suppose now that $L_{p,q} = L{p',q'}$ for some $(p,q) \neq (p',q')$. In particular there exists an isometry of $\H^2$ sending $p$ to $q$ and $p'$ to $q'$, which is unique since it fixes two points in $\H^2$. This gives a contradiction and therefore the map is injective.
\end{proof}

\noindent\textit{Spacelike geodesics}.
Let $l$ be a geodesic of $\H^2$. The one-parameter group of hyperbolic transormation fixing $l$ as an oriented geodesic is a spacelike geodesic through the identity. By an argument similar to the previous proposition, one proves that every spacelike geodesic is of the form
\[
    L_{l,j} = \{ X \in\PSL \ | \ X \cdot j = l \ \ \text{as oriented geodesics} \}
\]
where $l$ and $j$ are oriented geodesics of $\H^2$. Ecery spacelike geodesuc can be expressed in this form in two ways, as one can change the orientation of both $l$ and $j$. Every such choice corresponds to a choice of orientation for the spacelike geodesic. In other words, we can state the following:
\begin{proposition}
    There is a homeomorphism between the space of oriented spacelike geodesics of $\A^{2,1}$ and the product of two copies of $\partial \H^2 \times \partial \H^2 \ \setminus \ \Delta$, the space of oriented geodesics of $\H^2$. 
    The homeomorphism is equivariant for the action of $Isom_0(\A^{2,1}) \cong \PSL \times \PSL$.
\end{proposition}
